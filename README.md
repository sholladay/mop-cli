## Why?

 - Some of us have a lot of modules.
 - We often want to operate on modules in concert.
 - Easy maintenance means happy developers and users.

## Install

npm install mop-cli --global
```

## Usage

**NOTE: On Node < 7.6, `mop` needs to be `node --harmony "$(which mop)"`**

```console
$ mop --help

  Usage

  Example
    $ mop pinned
```

## API
