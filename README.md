# mop-cli [![Build status for mop-cli on Circle CI.](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/sholladay/mop-cli/master.svg "Circle Build Status")](https://circleci.com/gh/sholladay/mop-cli "Mop CLI Builds")

> Maintain your projects.

## Why?

 - Some of us have a lot of modules.
 - We often want to operate on modules in concert.
 - Easy maintenance means happy developers and users.

## Install

```sh
npm install mop-cli --global
```

## Usage

```console
$ mop --help

  Usage
    $ mop [pinned | outdated]

  Example
    $ mop pinned
```

*Tip: On Node < 7.6, `mop` needs to be `node --harmony "$(which mop)"`*

## Rules

See the [list of rules](docs/rules.md) to change what triggers `mop` to complain.

## Data types

### Project

A project is an object with `name`, `path` and `pkg` properties.

#### name

Type: `string`

Either `pkg.name` if it is available or the [basename](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_basename_path_ext) of the project's `path`.

#### path

Type: `string`

Filepath of the project's root directory.

#### pkg

Type: `object`, `null`

Parsed package.json found within `path`, or `null` if the file is missing. An error will be thrown if the file is present but cannot be read or is invalid.

### Project Result

A result is a project with additional properties for rule violations that were detected.

#### problems

Type: `Array<Problem>`

A list of all rule violations the project is responsible for.

#### errors

Type: `Array<Problem>`

Same as `problems`, but only those whose `severity` is `error`.

#### warnings

Type: `Array<Problem>`

Same as `problems`, but only those whose `severity` is `warn`.

### Problem

Each rule may optionally return a problem descriptor, which represents a rule violation. The only required property is `message`.

#### message

Type: `string`

A message describing the problem.

#### path

Type: `string`

Filepath that is responsible for the problem.

#### line

Type: `number`

A positive, zero-based integer within the file where the problem occurred.

#### column

Type: `number`

A positive, zero-based integer within the line where the problem occurred.

#### data

Type: any

Arbitrary data that reporters can use to enhance output.

---

**The problem descriptor will be enhanced with the following properties before it is returned to users.**

#### ruleId

Type: `string`

The rule that reported the problem.

#### severity

Type: `string`<br>
Example: `warn`

The problem level, as configured by the user for the rule.

## API

### mop(option)

Returns a `Promise` for an `Array` of project results.

#### option

##### cwd

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `process.cwd()`

Final directory in a downwards search for projects. Only used when no `projects` are provided.

##### projects

Type: `Array<Project>`

List of projects to lint.

##### rules
